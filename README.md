# TCP FSM Python Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a TCP connection protocol finite state machine (FSM) in Python, based on a provided Java FSM package. It models TCP states like `CLOSED`, `LISTEN`, `SYN_SENT`, etc., and transitions between them on TCP events.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Open a terminal inside the `TCP_FSM_Lab/` folder.
3. Run the main program:

```bash
python3 tcp_fsm_main.py
